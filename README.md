# Weather-journal-app
The second project of Udacity FWD Scholarship. 

#### What I used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Overview
This project was about creating an asynchronous web app that uses OpenWeatherMap API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

### Building
To get the project up and running I followed these steps:

1. Setting up project environment, making sure I have Node and packages installed, and included in my server.js file.
1. Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
1. Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
1. Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server. 
1. Set up a function that updated UI dynamically.
